## simple-javap

This is a simple java disassembler I wrote many years (more than 10) ago in C.
I seem to remember it did work, but after all this time I can't really be sure.
I think I only tested it on java 1.4 class files, so anything newer than that
can cause problems.

Comments are very sparse and I am not claiming the code is beautiful or represents
good C practices. This was back then more of a learning project for me, so
it might be amateurish. You have been warned.
